# Example Practical Test

## Problem to Solve

To start, we will need to get the paginated results from an API every 24 hours.  Then, save that data to a file and process it into a database.  Once that's complete, provide the ability retrieve those results using an API endpoint. Please provide tests for code written as well.

Run `pest --coverage` to run tests.
